🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL Server
Project: Adventure Works Dataset

📋 Project Overview:
This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pure SQL on a dataset Adventure Works.
The goal is to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and geographical trends using structured SQL queries only (no BI tools or Python).

🎯 Objectives:
1. Understand the structure and relationships between key business entities
2. Explore sales trends, profitability, and customer demographics
3. Perform data profiling (ranges, counts, unique values, etc.)
4. Create key performance metrics (KPIs) using SQL
5. Rank and segment products, customers, and regions


📊 EDA Phases and Insights:

1. Database Exploration:
   1. Viewed all tables and columns
   2. Checked completeness and integrity of data

2️. Dimensional Exploration:
   1. Identified Regions, Countries, Continents in Territory
   2. Listed all Categories, Subcategories, and Products

3️. Date Exploration:
   1. Determined first and last order dates
   2. Calculated time range of transactions
   3. Identified youngest and oldest customers

4️. Measures Exploration:
   1. Total Sales 
   2. Total Quantity Sold
   3. Total Profit	from Sales
   4. Total Quantity Returned
   5. Average Product Price
   6. Total Unique Orders 	Count
   7. Total Active customers and Inactive Customers

5. Magnitude & Distribution Analysis:
   1. Customers by country and gender
   2. Product sales by category
   3. Average price and revenue per category
   4. Income group segmentation (Low, Middle, High Income)

6. Ranking Analysis:
   1. Top 5 Performing Products
   2. Bottom 5 Products
   3. Top 10 Customers by Revenue
   4. Least Active Customers


🧮 SQL Concepts Used:
   1. Aggregate Functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()
   2. Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
   3. Conditional Logic: CASE WHEN
   4. Grouping & Filtering: GROUP BY, HAVING
   5. Ranking Functions: DENSE_RANK(), TOP N
   6. Data Profiling: DISTINCT, INFORMATION_SCHEMA


🧠 Skills Demonstrated:
   1. SQL Server Data Analysis
   2. Business Intelligence Querying
   3. Analytical Thinking

-- Data Cleaning & Profiling

-- Metric & KPI Development

-- SQL Optimization & Readability
